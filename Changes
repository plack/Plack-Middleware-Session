    - Fixed so the default Cookie path is now correctly set to '/'
      You can override that by setting path = undef in psgix.session.options.

    - Fixed a bug in Cookie serialization where it breaks the response headers
      generated by applications (tomyhero)

0.09_01 Sat Jan 30 13:39:21 PST 2010
    - Reworked the internal code and API a lot, so Session persistence
      and retrieval are handled in a more stateless way
    - INCOMPATIBLE: psgix.session is now a hash reference rather than an object.
      If you need an object like before, do:
        use Plack::Session; $session = Plack::Session->new($env);
    - Added Plack::Middleware::Session::Cookie which uses CookieStore
    - Updated Cookie handling code to work with Plack 0.99 and later

    * Plack::Middleware::Session

    * Plack::Session::Store::File
      - changed to lock_* versions of the Storaable functions
